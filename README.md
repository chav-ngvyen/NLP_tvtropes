According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon):

**Dragon:** A dragon is a reptile-like legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.

This is standard.

TV Tropes is a wiki website that collects and documents descriptions and examples of plot conventions and devices, more commonly known as tropes, within many creative works.[6] Since its establishment in 2004, the site has shifted focus from covering only television and film tropes to those in general media such as literature, comics, anime, manga, video games, radio, music, advertising, and toys, and their associated fandoms, as well as some non-media subjects such as history, geography, politics, and other real life occurrences, people, and events.[7][8] The nature of the site as a provider of commentary on pop culture and fiction has attracted attention and criticism from several web personalities and blogs.

Below is what TVTropes has to say about "Dragon":

#### The Dragon

##### The Big Bad needs a Number Two; this would be the Evil Counterpart of that (or The Lancer). He's the main villain's closest confidant (or something akin to it), frequently acts as his Foil, and may be seen working as the front-liner of the evil forces to personally carry out his master's orders as one of his most dangerous and competent subordinates.
